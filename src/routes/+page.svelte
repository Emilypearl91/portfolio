    The projects showcased are ones that I am most proud of and are currently
    working on. I started learning web development a year ago and since then I
    have been learning something new everyday that I can implement into my
    projects, making them more user friendly and useful. I really enjoyed making
    these projects and really enjoy the debugging process and obstacles I have
    faced while building these projects.

        The yarn project helper was created with friend and family in mind, it
        is meant to replace the random sheets of paper and notebooks filled with
        tally marks to mark where you are in a fiber art projects. Allowing for
        your project to be transportable. Another feature that is included is a
        calculator of sorts that allows for the user to determine how much the
        finished project is worth if they were looking to sell it. This project
        was created using vite, svelte, tailwind css, skeleton ui and creating a
        skeleton ui custom theme. Challenges I faced while working on this
        project was fixing the NAN error and saving the row counter to local
        storage.

        The blog project was created to work with supabase and svelte by
        creating a website that renders data from supabase. It was also created
        to share knowledge, opinions and advice on the hobbies I share with
        friends and family. This project was created with svelte, supabase,
        skeleton ui and tailwind css.

        A project that is currently in the works is getting the burger if the
        day from the bobâ€™s burger api and rendering it to be on a sheet of
        paper. Another is a book journal project that uses a database and user
        authentication. This project will allow for readers to keep track of
        their reading goals and journal their thoughts and catalog their own
        books. Another feature would have a book prompt generator that would
        help give an idea for the user to find what to read next.
