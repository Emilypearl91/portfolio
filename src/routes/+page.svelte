      Hello! My name is Emily and i am from calgary alberta. My background in
      the arts is how I found a passion for coding. I have been a classically
      trained flutist for the past 10 years while in highschool I graduated with
      a certificate of excellence in the arts, from there I chose to branch out
      and try something new. I went into digital design where I learned to
      design branding, logos, website design mockups, wireframes and write
      copywriting for brands. Through that I got to see the beginning steps in
      creating and coding a portfolio website using html, css and javascript, I
      really enjoyed the whole process and coding and chose to pursue that
      passion further at SAIT in the web developer program.
